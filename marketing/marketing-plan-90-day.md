# Rare Coin Marketing Plan - 90 Day Launch Strategy

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Build hype and drive 1,000,000 claimers to Rare Coin through coordinated Twitter, Telegram, and content marketing.

**Timeline:** 90 days (3 months)
**Budget:** $0 - Organic growth focus
**Team:** Felix (Director) + PaulySun (Founder)

---

## 1. BRAND POSITIONING

### Core Message
"Bot-proof distribution. Real utility. 1M ultra-rare tokens."

### Key Differentiators
1. **Bot-Proof** — Stake-to-Claim + Turnstile verification
2. **Ultra-Rare** — Only 1M tokens total (vs billions in other projects)
3. **Real Utility** — Staking, lottery, trading bot (not just a meme)
4. **Fair Launch** — No presale, no team allocation from claims
5. **Base Chain** — Fast, cheap, Coinbase-backed

### Target Audience
- **Primary:** Crypto natives who missed early Bitcoin/ETH
- **Secondary:** DeFi users looking for fair distribution
- **Tertiary:** Base Chain early adopters

### Tone of Voice
- Professional but approachable
- Transparent about challenges (we admit the bot problem)
- Educational (explain why bot-proofing matters)
- Community-focused (not hype-driven)

#### Thread 2: Why 1M Supply
```
1/ 💎 1,000,000 tokens. That's it.

Not 1 billion. Not 100 million. Just 1M.

Here's why ultra-rare matters more than ever:

#### Thread 3: How Stake-to-Claim Works

## 9. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

### Fair Launch Tokens

| Project | Supply | Chain | Bot Protection |
|---------|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Rare Coin** | 1M | Base | Stake-to-Claim + Turnstile |
| Project A | 1B | ETH | None |
| Project B | 100M | SOL | CAPTCHA only |
| Project C | 10M | Base | None |

### Our Advantages
1. Lowest supply (1M = most scarce)
2. Strongest bot protection (dual-layer)
3. Real utility (staking, lottery, trading)
4. Transparent about past failures

### Differentiation Strategy
- Lead with bot-proofing (unique angle)
- Emphasize scarcity (1M vs billions)
- Show real utility (not just claims)
- Be transparent (we failed before, we learned)
